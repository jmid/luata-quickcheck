LuaTA : Lua Type Analysis and corresponding QuickCheck code
===========================================================

This is a static analysis for conservatively inferring run-time types
of Lua programs. It forms the case study contained in the paper

    QuickChecking Static Analysis Properties
    Jan Midtgaard and Anders MÃ¸ller
    Proceedings of ICST'15
    http://janmidtgaard.dk/papers/Midtgaard-Moeller:ICST15.pdf

which focuses on testing properties related to static analyses
(lattice properties, and monotonicity, strictness, and invariance of
operations) using the increasingly popular QuickCheck methodology.

Note: the present analysis has been updated since the publication of
the above paper.


The full source code of the analysis is available from this
very URL https://github.com/jmid/luata-quickcheck

The analysis can be built as a command line client or as a web client
available at http://jmid.github.io/luata-quickcheck/

The coverage reports mentioned in the paper are available in the sub-directories:

 - [cov-report-qcheck](http://jmid.github.io/luata-quickcheck/cov-report-qcheck/)
   is based solely on QuickChecking.

 - [cov-report-test](http://jmid.github.io/luata-quickcheck/cov-report-test/)
   is based solely on our test suite of programs.

 - [cov-report-combined](http://jmid.github.io/luata-quickcheck/cov-report-combined/)
   is the combination of the two above.


Requirements:
-------------

- OCaml, version 4.01.0 or newer
  - ocamlp4-extra (for 'camlp4of', required by bisect below)
- OCaml libraries/tools (through OPAM):
  - ocamlfind
  - [qcheck](https://github.com/c-cube/qcheck/) v.0.2
  - [ounit](http://ounit.forge.ocamlcore.org/) v.2.0.0
  - [bisect](http://bisect.x9c.fr/) v.1.3 (for coverage reports)
- GNU Make

The web interface further requires:
- [Js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/) (available through OPAM)
- [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net) (included)
- [TextHover addon]("https://github.com/angelozerr/CodeMirror-XQuery/tree/master/codemirror-extension/addon/hover") to CodeMirror (also included)

Analysis instructions:
----------------------

The file `doc/luata-doc.md` provides a basic description of the
analysis architecture as well as an explanation of its output.

The analysis comes with both a command line interface and a web
client. 

To build the command line client, run:

    $ make

To run the analysis on a Lua program, for example (see
examples/ directory for other examples):

    $ ./luata examples/table06.lua

The result will now be printed to the console.

To reduce the amount of console output passing the option `-no-heap`
will just emit the warnings:

    $ ./luata -no-heap examples/table06.lua


Alternatively you can build the web client with

    $ make js

The web client is now available as an HTML page with overlays
in `index.html` (view with a web browser and shrink fontsize).


Quickcheck instructions:
------------------------

 The source code for the QuickCheck LCheck module is included
 in `src/lCheck.ml` for convenience, but is also separately available
 from http://github.com/jmid/lcheck

 The source code applying LCheck to the Lua type analyses is
 available in `src/edslcheck.ml`

 To rerun our quickchecking on the type analysis:

    $ make -B edslcheck
    $ ./edslcheck

 Warning: the last step takes a full lunchbreak! You can comment out
 some tests at the bottom of `src/edslcheck.ml` to run fewer tests.


Report instructions:
--------------------

To reproduce the numbers in the paper's Table 1, regarding
QuickCheck, test suite, and combined coverage, follow the below
instructions.

* To reproduce the QuickCheck coverage numbers:

  Run:

      $ make -B edslcheckcov
      $ make -B runedslcheckcov
      $ make -B checkreport

  (Warning: the second step takes a full lunchbreak)
  The resulting report is now available in HTML format in `cov-report-qcheck/index.html`


* To reproduce the original test suite coverage numbers:

  Run:

      $ make -B testcov
      $ make -B runtestcov
      $ make -B testreport

  The resulting report is now available in HTML format in `cov-report-test/index.html`


* To reproduce the combined coverage numbers:

  First run both the above (which will generate cov-report-qcheck.out
  and cov-report-test.out). Then

      $ make -B combinedreport

  The resulting report is now available in HTML format in `cov-report-combined/index.html`
