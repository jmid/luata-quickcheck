        TeCGraf is the result of a partnership between PUC-Rio,
        the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro,
        and <A HREF="http://www.petrobras.com.br/">PETROBRAS</A>,

        TeCGraf is Lua's birthplace,
        and the language has been used there since 1993.
        Currently, more than thirty programmers in TeCGraf use
        Lua regularly; they have written more than two hundred
        thousand lines of code, distributed among dozens of
        final products.]]
